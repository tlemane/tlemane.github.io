I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://labgem.genoscope.cns.fr/">LABGeM</a> team at <a href="https://jacob.cea.fr/drf/ifrancoisjacob/Pages/Departements/Genoscope.aspx">Genoscope</a>, working on computational methods for read classification using pangenome graphs for antimicrobial resistance tracking as part of the <a href="https://www.abromics.fr/">ABRomics project</a>.

Broadly, my work focuses on algorithms and data structures for large-scale processing of sequencing collections, with an emphasis on indexing problems. Recently, we released the first k-mer search engine, [`Logan Search`](/news/logan-search), capable of querying the largest sequencing data repository, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">Sequence Read Archive</a> (SRA).
