I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://lage.genoscope.cns.fr/">LAGE</a> team at <a href="https://jacob.cea.fr/drf/ifrancoisjacob/Pages/Departements/Genoscope.aspx">Genoscope</a>. My research work concerns algorithms and data structures for large-scale processing of complex sequencing banks as metagenomes from the <a href="https://fondationtaraocean.org/en/home/">Tara projet</a> with a focus on large-scale indexing problems. Recently, I have also started developing user interfaces by leveraging these sequence indexes. Using these tools, we recently released the first SRA-scale k-mer search engine: [`Logan Search`](/news/logan-search)

Previously I have developed methods and [tools](/tools) for constructing, streaming and filtering k-mers matrices from large sequencing collections.
